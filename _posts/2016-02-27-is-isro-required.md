Some people are furious about this. They think stopping the funds delivered to ISRO can bring up the Indian economy. Never have i seen such an ignorance any where. Today i will tell you why all the premiere Indians and government believe in India. Why ISRO is earning millions in its own revenue and at the same time helping India advance in economy.

1) What do you know about Spin off technologies?
Well there are many spin off technologies particularly from Space research.
I am going to mention 2 of the ISRO spin offs which i found very interesting.

* The state of the art Automatic Weather Station (AWS) developed by ISRO is designed as a very compact, modular, rugged, powerful, low cost system and housed in a portable, self contained package. The AWS consists of compact Data Transmitter, Data Logger, Crossed Yagi Antenna, GPS, Solar Panel and Meteorological Sensors (e.g. air temp., relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction, wind speed, solar radiation, rain gauge, etc.). AWS Transmits Meteorological data every hour from any remote station installed within the foot print of INSAT Satellite. The DRT on board INSAT satellite has capacity to accommodate over 10,000 such AWS systems spread over the country. The AWS can immediately provide information on weather and an anomaly from normal/expected weather.

* Search and Rescue Beacon is an affordable and technically advanced electronic device that helps to rescue people in distress through satellite communication. The beacon transmits encoded digital message that contains information about the beacon, such as its unique identification number, country where the beacon is registered etc. along with current location of the beacon. The beacon gets location information from Global Positioning System (GPS). Various search and rescue satellites under COSPAS-SARSAT network receive the transmitted signals. The messages are processed and retransmitted to different ground stations. These dedicated ground stations receive the message and alert the rescue centres nearest to the spot of accident. The rescue centre in turn initiates the rescue operations. The beacon can be used in sea, on difficult terrains on the land and in air by various groups of people.  
Many other spin offs from ISRO can be found at the following link.

And not only this, see what America got with NASA here..  
[NASA spin-off technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies)
Now, you would miss most of those advanced technology if it were not for ISRO’s  Advanced space research.  

2) Now normal Remote sensing satellites have a lot of Direct uses on an average Indian citizen. Atmospheric data can help us avoid or predict natural disasters and guide us in taking precautionary measures. Remote sensing satellites on the other hand give us valuable inputs in Farming, Urban planning, Administration, Military, Strategic, Tactical procedures, Security, Emergency , Entertainment, Education , Medical purposes.

All of these services can be availed by the Indian Government and if you go to USA begging this data , I Bet on it, it would cost us Fortunes than what we are doing now. More over, USA and Russia have a monopoly over the navigation system, so we have to be dependent on them if we have to use our guided missiles on our Enemies. Now with IRNSS coming in, we can straight up say F**k off to GPS and GLONASS, Eshtablishing ourselves as a regional superpower. All this for a mere budget of 0.05 times that of NASAs. This is an Awesome package, Isn’t it?????

3) If you are referring to only that particular Mars orbitter mission, then i advice you to please refer to the objectives or Mars orbitter mission. They publicly state that its a Technology Demonstrator mission. That means they want to give hints to the open world, that they are able to launch an Interplanetary satellite into extraterrestrial orbit, which directly implies many things.
First off ,we can reach any point in space. That means we can destroy any things that’s out there roaming. China did it explicitly by sending a rocket and destroying a satellite generating heaps of space debris. We almost did the same thing but on a constructive purpose -> By studying the atmosphere of mars. If you want to know more about the technicalities of what MOM would do, please read my paper at Mars Orbiter Mission of ISRO.
Secondly , such projects give a boost to the intellectual property and inspiration of the Indians. See how many children are now interested in ISRO and MARS . More number of people are now interested in Aerospace and Astrophysics rather than Computer science and IT which most of the engineers choose today. See this letter writter to ISACs director by a school boy in Bangalore.

Third thing is it is a passion for people like me , to do advanced space study. ISRO provides us an brilliant oppurtunity for doing that by staying in India! Now if all of the scientist escape to Foreign countries and develop their technology, how can India develop? No, right? All the military technology can be directly implied from space research and you don’t want that to be in the hands of Foreigners. That is why India and Indians believe in ISRO.

4) India all through the history of Human civilization was leading in innovation and technology but it went back during the renaissance period because of general Islamic and European invasions. We are intelligent, but we were killed and made slaves. Wouldn’t you want us to lead the world again in that sector? Creating science and inventing things?

5) Well, coming to poverty. ISRO is absolutely justified when you talk about poverty. Wondering how? Well, Distributing money to people lying around wouldn’t make any bloody sense, would it? Instead bringing up people who are working hard with a government pay roll would take a step towards poverty. When people talk about eliminating poverty, that’s what you talk of right? Government giving jobs in some companies. Well that companies need investment for setting the machines and infrastructure, here the investment goes in rocket technology. DUH. No argument here.
ISRO has given you a chance to stand with your face lifted up any where in the world. ISRO is your countries brains put together. ISRO is yours. ISRO is you. Be proud to have such an efficient working organisation in your country producing amazing results unlike Pakistans :p #JAIHIND
