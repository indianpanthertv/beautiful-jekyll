In real life there are multiple strategies in the books of generals of both the Indian Tri forces and PLA of China. But here i will describe a platform necessary to win a war with the China.
The Famous war strategist Sun Tzu of Ancient china once said :
<blockquote class="blocky">Know your self and the Enemy both IN and OUT. Try then to win the Enemy without a WAR! Greatest victories are won without a war. But if a war is inevitable, Knowing the enemy will give you the greatest edge over them.</blockquote>
Firstly lets discuss about a war with China. Both our countries are the Economic work horses of this world. If a war arises between us then it essentially shall be the Third World War. Each and every economy will collapse, every one will take sides. Russia will too. Now which country takes which sides will all depend on the strategy and the point of War.
If the war is because of Chinese Aggression, then necessarily India will be on an Ethical upper step. But Chinese never will attack without an apt reason. So, the entire geopolitical structure of the East Asia will come into picture. If a war happens then it must be because of the following reasons.
<blockquote class="blocky">1) South China Sea Disputes.</blockquote>
India is pursuing its goals in and around vietnam so passionately. Also India is a major ally of Japan, South Korea, Australia and the other Island nations there. This itself is a worrying point for China. If India extends its naval influence to a level more than a threshold in the disputed region, then the chinese will respond because of their fear over the OIL trade on the waters.
<blockquote class="blocky">2) Chinese agression over Indian Mainland.</blockquote>
There are many disputed border regions between India and China. For many strategic regions china can opt for a take over of those regions. This will lead to a war just like the historic Indo-China War!
<blockquote class="blocky">3) Yet another Pakistan India war</blockquote>
Well there can be thousand reasons for a war between pakistan and India , and Sooner or later India will eventually come closer to a win over the war, then being an ally of pakistan , China will fear the growing control of India in the central Asia region and it may open another war front in the West side for us , just to dilute us.
This is a weak probability because Chinese will be involved on an underground basis here. The only way this can become a reality is if Chinese go mad with the growing Indian power.
<blockquote class="blocky">4) Taking sides in world war 3 started by other countries.</blockquote>
If India and China are on opposite sides of the Coalitions of the World war 3 then we  are eventually going to fight arenâ€™t we?
Now that we have a cumbersome list of WHY we have to fight the enemy, lets go to HOW we can fight the enemy. The crux of the answer to this question.
<blockquote class="blocky">I) Detect the Aggression :</blockquote>
After the Indo China war India felt a deep lack of urgency for responding to the Chinese aggression and started many organisations. Some of them are Internal parts of Military and also RAW. The first thing to do after we detect a slightest hint of chinese troop movements towards India, is to send undercover agents to gather the details about the quantity and the quality of the regiments that China aims to use for the Attack. Also remember that India is one of the leaders in remote sensing satellites. And we have a couple of highly qualified satellites just for this purpose. Once we have the data we can start preparation.
<blockquote class="blocky">ii) Prepare for the Attack :</blockquote>
Mean while we start preparing Diplomatic options and Geo Political options. This is where knowing the Enemy IN AND OUT will help. China has a deep problem with Tibet and various other cultures. India will then use the Military wing of RAW , theSpecial Frontier Force

or some other para military troops to get in China and create instabilities in the very fabric of China. People of China are a little bit resistant towards government about the freedom of speech and various other democratic ideologies. We can use that or some other cultural issue like Tibet or religious issues to create little disturbances. This can be used against India also through Pakistani millitants. This is the time the DEMOCRACY of India will support us. Our leaders must keep all of us together. We ourselves must always believe in our brothers of other religions even at the time of certain attrocities which will be done by anti social elements. I believe that can be easily done in here. Once and for all we will have the details of the attack and the same time ignite a Chinese Hinterland instability.
 <blockquote class="blocky">iii) The Great Himalayas , The Nepal and The BHUTAN! :</blockquote>
Yeah Nature and Geopolitics are in our advantage here. We have got Military and ideoligical ties with Nepal and also BHUTAN is our dearest ally. In recent times Bangladesh has also been a very good one sider with India. Himalayas here can be used to our advantage. Troop movement with mechanised heavy vehicles is a burdern in the himalayan region. The only war that is fought in the higher altitudes is gureilla war and sniper war. We maintain a full fledged military base in Bhutan. Most of the surrounding regions and tribes will support India and Tibetians will surely side with India with a compelling advocacy of the Dalai lama or the other Buddhist leaders. So, we can mobilize troops more than what we have and can defend our positions. We will always have a support of Chinese inner movements from our agents and we can defend.
<blockquote class="blocky">iv) World SHALL DIVIDE :</blockquote>
USA will choose India. Becuase China is an economic competitor of USA. If China goes USA still has India to get its goods manufactured.
Russia will choose China. Because they are ideological partners and Enemies of USA
North Korea will help China :p
South Korea, Japan , Vietnam , Australia, France , UK , Myanmar , Bangladesh, Indonesia Will help us in our war. They can create instabilites in South China sea or the surrounding areas to divert chinese attention and to block the chinese trade.
Pakistan will choose China. May even open another front on the Kashmir , Rajasthan side of India.
India will then opt for Tajikistani AIR BASE support combined with Afghan and IRAN support to counter Pakistan. Also we must be having lot of intel links right now inside pak itself so even if Pakistan opens a war front we can defend with the support.
<blockquote class="blocky">V) Scale of the WAR :</blockquote>
If China pushes into India and gives us a very tough fight, then our allies will start economic blockades over china. China is a work house. It gets raw material , makes stuff and sells it. If it gets no business, how is it going to pay any one? As i said , Indian Diplomacy is far stronger than any other country. And, countries with formidable leaderships will chose a Democracy rather than a Hard Core communist country just looking for business. So Economic sanctions will play a major role.
If China gets its lesson by now, it will pull back. If the leadership of China gets mad, they will pursuade for a full scale major war occupation of India along with Pakistan.
That there will trigger a Nuclear war with missiles destroying entire cities. If atleast one Nuclear weapon is used by Pakistan, USA will start its invasion over pakistan to seize its weapons. So, we can concentrate on our western front. Russia will probably try to get to afghanistan again. But the Economic blockades on Russia will destroy the country completely. So it wont do any stupid thing until a security threat is there personally to Russia itself. So we are having China encircled by all our allies and the Strong Indian Army can do anything! Chinese borders are long as f**k and if they concentrate their army towards oneside we can attack from the other side, As we will have a strong presence both on the west side of china ( throught South china sea) also on the eastern side( Central asia and kashmir region). So, there is no point for China to destroy itself and the stature it has in the world now.
The above article  is entirely based on one point that USA will support India. If USA goes on chinese side by saying some stupid logic, then another long answer is required. This time also India can win but it will require Instabilites in USA with Pakistani support :p hahahahahaha!
