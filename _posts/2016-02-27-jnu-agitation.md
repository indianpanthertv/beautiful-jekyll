>Bharat ke tukde honge hazaar  
Bharat ki barbadi tak jung zaari rahegi  
Allahu Akbar  

That’s what you have to know about what is happening in JNU. That’s what is being shouted by a group of students who gathered , some with the masks on their faces to hide their identity. Because most of them do not believe in the things they are shouting (or) they are not true Indians. After all , how can an Indian shout for his own destruction? Well, they donot have the permission to that in their own campus. The Jawaharlal Nehru University was established on a preamble to nurture the talent not to destroy the India.

Bharat ki Barbadi and Allahu Akbar are the two words which can raise serious concerns about their deep intentions. Necessarily The Republic of India grants religious freedom to every living being living on its land boundaries unlike some of the Neighbouring countries, but why would you want a god to live for ever and the Barbadi of a billion Indians?

This question is not to all the devotional muslims and true Indians here. They are our brothers and can do any thing. This question is to the people who want the destruction and fragmentation of India and a resonant Allah.

My dear students, have you never sung the melodious National anthem of India?
You must have done it. If you didnot , then you can go just keep your mouth shut. Because we are not going to listen to people who are not Indians about the decisions which our Indians courts took. And if you did sing the Jana gana mana, then what does it say?

>Jaana Gaana Maana Adhinayaka Jayehe  
Bharata bhagya vidhata;  
Punjaba Sindhu Gujarata Maratha,  
Dravida Utkala Banga,  
Vindhya, Himachala, Jamuna, Ganga,    
Ucchhala Jaladhitaranga;  
Taba Shubha Naame Jaage  
Taba Shubha Ashish Maage  
Gaye taba jaya gaatha.  
Jana gana mangala dayaka jaya he  
Bharata bhagya vidhata.  
Jaya he, jaya he, jaya he,  
Jaya jaya jaya, jaya he!  
And Just so You know! They mean this -_-  

>Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people,  
Dispenser of India’s destiny.  
Thy name rouses the hearts of the Punjab,  
Sind, Gujarat, and Maratha,  
Of the Dravid, and Orissa and Bengal.  
It echoes in the hills of Vindhyas and,  
Himalayas, mingles in the music of the  
Jamuna and the Ganges and is chanted by  
the waves of the Indian sea.  
The pray for the blessings,  
and sing by the praise,  
The saving of all people  
waits in thy hand.  
Thou dispenser of India’s destiny,  
Victory, victory, victory to thee.  
Victory Victory Victory to thee. To India , To Bharat Mata, To the Billion people living here.  

JAYA HE. Jai HIND.

That song has all of us. That pledge has the blessings of all the gods along with your Allah. That pledge has the prayers of all the Hindus, Christians, Muslims , Sikhs, Buddhists and everyone living in India. Your Allah will always be Akbar , but your foul intentions will not.

And by the way for a second do not even think that you can divide us Hindus and Muslims with your sickening , foul slogans. Our brothers know what Allah supports. Your slogans just have been said by may be a hundred students. But these words below have been said by a billion people, please learn the song if you like it and sing if you can.

Saare jahan se acha, HINDUSTAN hamara.

And still if you think Kashmir is yours then you can go talk to the Strong Indian Army who is guarding our borders and protecting you. May be they will give you a good answer.

And Finally  Who ever is reading this. Share this message so that it reaches those duffers and anti-nationals. Let them shit in their own land. Idiots of a kind.
